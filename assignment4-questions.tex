{\huge \textbf{K-Means}} \\

The~\href{https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/homework-4/data/}{normalized automobile distributor timing speed and ignition coil gaps} for production F-150 trucks over the years of 1996, 1999, 2006, 2015, and 2022. We have stripped out the labels for the five years of data.\\
\\
Each sample in the dataset is two-dimensional, i.e. $\textbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^2$ (one dimension for timing speed and the other for coil gaps), and there are $N=5000$ instances in the data.
\\

{\Large \textbf{Question 1} [20 pts total]} \\

\textbf{[10 pts] Question 1a.)} Implement a simple $k$-means algorithm in Python on Colab with the following initialization:

\begin{equation}
\textbf{x}_1 = \left( \begin{matrix} 10 \\ 10 \end{matrix} \right), \textbf{x}_2 = \left( \begin{matrix} -10 \\ -10 \end{matrix} \right),
\textbf{x}_3 = \left( \begin{matrix} 2 \\ 2 \end{matrix} \right),
\textbf{x}_4 = \left( \begin{matrix} 3 \\ 3 \end{matrix} \right),
\textbf{x}_5 = \left( \begin{matrix} -3 \\ -3 \end{matrix} \right),
\nonumber
\end{equation} \\

You need only 100 iterations, maximum, and your algorithm should run very quickly to get the results. \\

\textbf{[5 pts] Question 1b.)} Scatter the results in two dimensions with different clusters as different colors. You can use \textbf{matplotlib}'s \textbf{pyplot} functionality:

\begin{verbatim}
>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>> plt.scatter(<YOUR CODE HERE>)
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{[5 pts] Question 1c.)} You will notice that in the above, there are only five initialization clusters. Why is $k=5$ a logical choice for this dataset? After plotting your resulting clusters, what do you notice? Did it cluster very well? Is there an initialization that would make it cluster well?\\
\\

{\Large \textbf{Question 2)}[30 pts total]} \\

In the data from Question 1, let \textbf{x} and \textbf{y} be two instances, i.e., they are each truck with separate measurements.  A common distance metric is the \emph{Mahalanobis Distance} with a specialized matrix $P \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$ that is written as follows: 

\begin{equation}
d(\textbf{x}, \textbf{y}) = ( \textbf{x} - \textbf{y} )^T P^{-1} ( \textbf{x} - \textbf{y} )
\nonumber
\end{equation} \\

In scalar format (non-matrix format), the Mahalanobis Distance can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    d(\textbf{x}, \textbf{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^2 \sum_{j=1}^2 (x_i - y_i) \cdot P^{-1}_{i,j} \cdot (x_j - y_j)
    \nonumber
\end{equation}

where \textbf{x} and \textbf{y} are two instances of dimensionality 2, and $d(\textbf{x}, \textbf{y})$ is the distance between them. In the case of the F150 engine components, $P$ is a known relationship through Ford's quality control analysis each year, where it is numerically shown as below: \\

\begin{equation}
 P = \left(
\begin{matrix}
10 & 0.5 \\
-10 & 0.25
\end{matrix}
\right) \nonumber
\end{equation}
\\

\textbf{[15 pts] Question 2a.)} Using the same data as \textbf{Question 1} and the same initialization instances $\{\textbf{x}_1, \textbf{x}_2, \textbf{x}_3, \textbf{x}_4, \textbf{x}_5 \}$ implement a specialized $k$-means with the above Mahalanobis Distance. Scatter the results with the different clusters as different colors. \\

What do you notice? You may want to pre-compute $P^{-1}$ so that you aren't calculating an inverse every single loop of the the $k$-Means algorithm. \\
\\
\textbf{[5 pts] Question 2b.)}
Calculate and print out the principle components of the aggregate data. \\
\\
\textbf{[5 pts] Question 2c.)}
Calculate and print out the principle components of \emph{each cluster}. Are they the same as the aggregate data? Are they the same as each other?\\

\textbf{[5 pts] Question 2d.)}
Take the eigenvector / eigenvalue decomposition of $P^T$ and subsequently, take their product. That is to say, 

\begin{equation}
    \{\Lambda, \Phi\} = \verb"eig"\left( P^T \right)
    \nonumber
\end{equation}

where $\Lambda = \left( \begin{matrix} \lambda_1 & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_2 \end{matrix} \right)$ and $\Phi$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix with $\phi_i \in \mathbb{R}^2$, a column in $\Phi$. Calculate a new $P'$ such that

\begin{equation}
    P' = \Lambda \Phi \nonumber
\end{equation}
\\
What is the relationship between $P'$ and the data?

Consider $F_3$ as the following set of frequent 3-itemsets:

\begin{verbatim}
{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 5}, {1, 3, 4}, 
{2, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 5}, {3, 4, 5}.
\end{verbatim} \\

Assume that there are only five items in the data set. \\
